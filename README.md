CS Eng. Programming Assignment 

#Server

To start our program run the java file using the “java” command in the terminal . 
  Eg.    java <file> <port>
By default, the port is 4231, and thus running the file with no arguments , uses the default address and port.
##Note : You will need to run the respective server first then the client 
##Note : All path are “complete paths” in the code, when using with another computer , pls change the path address. 

#Client

To start our program run the java file using the “java” command in the terminal . 
  Eg.    java <file>  <server address> <port>
By default, the server address is localhost and port is 4231, and thus running the file with no arguments , uses the default address and port.
Once the file is running , it’ll prompt you for input , indicated by a “>>”. You can type your commands after the symbol
“send <filename>” is the command that sends the file with filename to the initialized address.
“exit” is the command to end a session.
